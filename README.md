# Coding Challenges

Selected challenges from the Coding Challenges website: https://codingchallenges.fyi/

The challenges will be written in C# to run on the .NET Framework/Core, or in TypeScript/JavaScript to run in Node.js environments. This will largely be based on my mood, though sometimes, I will take strenghts of the platform into account. ðŸ™‚

Each challenge will be grouped into a folder with the name of the challenge.
